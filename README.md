# Features
Your trip is arranged based on the weather forecast and the comments online.   
We collect comments from TripAdvisor (https://www.tripadvisor.com.tw/Attractions), quantize the emotion expressed by calculating the valance score and the arousal score, which is the rate of positivity and excitement respectively, and finally figure out whether people like the spot or not.
Moreover, people usually stay indoor on rainy days. But!!! Still there are places worthy to be visited. Based on the data we accumulated, we recommend places that are nice and pretty, suitable for you to go even when it rains, providing you wonderful traveling plans under any kind of weather condition.
