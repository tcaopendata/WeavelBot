# Features
The route we planned for you is not only based on the weather, but also combined with the comment online.   
We collect comment data from the website(https://www.tripadvisor.com.tw/Attractions). According to the score named "Valence score", judging how positive the mood is, and "Arousal score", judging how excited person is, we can know whether people like the place or not.   
Gernally, people think that when rainy outside, we are lazy and lie in the sofa. But!!! There's some place good for rainy to go.   
Based on the data we have cleared and calculated, we can get some place which you go in the rainy day is also good and pretty.   
We can give you good plans in any kind of weather condition.
